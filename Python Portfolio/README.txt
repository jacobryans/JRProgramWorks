This is a portfolio for all of my works in Python.
Read below for descriptions on each project.

Hack.Out -
My biggest overall Python project, was done in 75 hours using the
pygame library. I did this project after programming in Python for
6-7 months consecutively and at the end of the project I understand
Python much better than the presented work. There were exceptions
and inefficiency in some of the code but I had to submit it as it
was due to a deadline. I understand the inefficiencies and
exceptions and can fix them though. This was my first solo-project
and it was a great learning experience.


Textbasedrpg (Typogamy) -
This is a text-based RPG engine with dynamic map generation.
The project was done for fun and it shows the depth of my
knowledge on efficient, in-depth python code. View the map
generation system as it is one of the best parts of the game.


Fraction Enhancer -
This is a small program that can calculate data in fraction form.
It was done as an assignment in my first programming class in
college. This could be easily conformed to a larger system for
data calculation

2D Pt. Plotter -
A small program that can plot 2d points based on input. Not a very
robust program but it's very useful if plotting data to a chart. 

Chaos Game -
This program is used to generate fractals. It currently produces
a Sirpenski triangle but can be set for more vertices. Neat program

RoomRev - 
This game is a small exploration project I worked on. I incorporated
a small combat system aswell using HP and Level values.

Simon - 
This was done in compatibility with a Raspberry Pi v3. It's a 
version of the old children's game that was very popular.
